In this post, I'll walk you through the journey of creating this portfolio website. From choosing the right technologies to deploying it on Vercel, I'll share the challenges I faced and the lessons I learned.

## The Tech Stack

I chose Next.js for its powerful features like server-side rendering and static site generation, which are great for performance and SEO. For the UI, I opted for Material-UI, a popular React component library that provides a set of beautiful and customizable components. And of course, TypeScript was a must for ensuring type safety and improving the development experience.

## The Process

The development process was iterative. I started with a basic layout and gradually added more features and content. One of the most challenging parts was designing the project detail page, which required a flexible and extensible architecture to accommodate different types of projects.

## What's Next

I'm constantly looking for ways to improve this website. Some of the things I'm planning to work on next are:

- Adding more projects and blog posts
- Improving the design and user experience
- Optimizing the performance even further

Stay tuned for more updates!
